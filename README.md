## Hello there 👋

I'm the Founder and lead programmer of VirtualSpace AppSec. Ever wrote code with hidden vulnerabilities that traditional scanners missed? VirtualSpace AppSec is your AI-powered security guardian – detecting the critical flaws that even GPT-4 overlooks. We've trained our models on thousands of real-world exploits, creating a specialized AI that thinks like an attacker, not a code reviewer.

No more bad filtered false positives drowning out real threats. Our supreme accuracy means you fix what matters, not chase ghosts. From buffer overflows to logic bombs, we catch the vulnerabilities that keep security teams up at night. Specially built and optimized for the programming languages C/++, Python, JS, and .NET applications – where one mistake can compromise everything.

Join the developers who've stopped playing security roulette. Scan smarter. Write safer. Sleep better. 🛡️
